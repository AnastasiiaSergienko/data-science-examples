    "# Data processing and linear regression with Exasol\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is for users who want to use Exasol as a data source for training a linear regression model. \n",
    "However, the data analyzing and processing part can also be interesting to anyone who's looking for information on how to prepare a dataset for training. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will discuss the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Part 1. How to import a dataset from CSV file to Exasol database.\n",
    "- Part 2. How to analyze the data in the table.\n",
    "- Part 3. How to prepare data for using it in a linear regression model.\n",
    "- Part 4. How to create and train a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model in this example will predict a flight's arriving delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "The users are assumed to have a basic understanding of Exasol, SQL and basic Python programming knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1. Importing data\n",
    "\n",
    "In our tutorial, we use `Flights.csv` file which provides information about U.S. domestic flights from 1987 to the 2019 year.\n",
    "The file has more than 184 million rows and 109 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the CSV file is too big, - more than 80 GB - we can't work with it directly importing is as a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "That's why we need to use a database as a warehouse and a workbench for a future data transformation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the first step: **we start an Exasol Database**. \n",
    "For this tutorial, we installed an Exasol Cloud Image using [Exasol Cloud Wizard](https://cloudtools.exasol.com/#/).\n",
    "If you want to know more about Exasol Cloud Wizard, you can read an article about how to use this tool in our [blog](https://www.exasol.com/en/blog/building-clusters-in-the-sky-exasol-cloud-wizard/).\n",
    "A local Exasol node was not a good option in our case because a local machine with this node proceeds data much slower than the cloud image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step: **import data from CSV file to Exasol's table**. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We create an SQL CREATE TABLE statement and put it in a separate file named `flights.sql`.\n",
    "Our table will have 109 columns according to the CSV file. Here is a part of the query:"

    "\n",
    "Now when we have a dataset in the Exasol table, we can start analyzing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we should take a look at the columns list and decide which of them we would use for the model's training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do we decide which columns we need?   \n",
    "\n",
    "We just look at the columns one by one and judge whether it can be helpful for prediction or not.\n",
    "A few examples of columns which we decided to use in our model for delay prediction:\n",
    "- Day of week\n",
    "- Departure airport\n",
    "- Arrival airport, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "And also a few columns which we decided NOT to use:\n",
    "- Flight number: a unique number that represents an exact flight.\n",
    "- Delay reason: we don't need a reason to predict a delay.\n",
    "- Canceled: this information doesn't affect delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to handle columns with similar information?\n",
    "\n",
    "As we don't need the repeated information, we should select only one column which suits best to the model.\n",
    "For example, we have three columns:\n",
    "- Origin Airport: name of an airport as a string.\n",
    "- Origin Airport ID: an identification number assigned by US DOT to identify a unique airport. \n",
    "- Origin Airport Sequence ID: an identification number assigned by US DOT to identify a unique airport at a given point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "These columns encode the same information but in different ways. We would select the second one - Origin Airport ID, for the model.\n",
    "The first reason - it's numeric. And the second - this code is more stable than the Origin Airport Sequence ID as it can't be changed later.\n",
    "The first reason - it's numeric. And the second - this code is more stable than the Origin Airport Sequence ID as it can't be changed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analyzing selected columns\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to collect data about the content of the selected columns. \n",
    "Here is a small list which can give you an idea of how to analyze a column:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How many null values does the column contain?\n",
    "2. How are the data represented in the column: string, number, date, etc?\n",
    "3. How many distinct values does the column contain?\n",
    "4. What are the maximum and minimum values (for numbers)?\n",
    "\n",
    "For our example, we collected data using `pyexasol` and then created charts with `plotly` library."

    "### Normalizing data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before loading the data into the model, we need to normalize it. \n",
    "Data normalization is a process in which the data that has different ranges is cast to a certain interval, such as [0,1] or [-1,1]. \n",
    "Normalization can significantly increase the accuracy of the model. If normalization is not applied, it can lead to incorrect and inaccurate results.\n",
    "There are a few different ways to normalize the data depending on the type of data the column contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "We divided our columns into two groups depending on the types of values:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Numerical values with natural order — values that contain numbers in which sequence is important. \n",
    "    For example, for days of the month, it is important that the 29th comes before the 30th. In this group, we have the following columns: `year`, `month`, `day of month`, `day of week`, `delay`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Categorical values — here we have values that can be grouped into a limited amount of categories.\n",
    "    A few examples of the columns from this group: `origin airport id`, `origin city id`, `destination state fips` etc.\n",
